# Ethereum Historical Data Endpoints

This page contains a **community-maintained list of Ethereum historical data endpoints**, including **Era1, Era, E2ss files, and torrents**.

> ⚠️ This list should not be treated as a single source of truth for these endpoints, or the data they provide. It is a **community-maintained list**, and as such, some endpoints listed here may not be up to date, or may not provide the data they claim to be providing.

Historical data providers offer **three primary storage formats**:
- **Era1**(Pre-Merge) - Archive nodes providing **execution layer history** before The Merge (ETH1).
- **Era**(Post-Merge) - Execution layer history **from The Merge onward**, including historical block data.
- **E2ss**(State) - **State snapshots** for execution clients.
- **Erb**(Blob) - Era file equivalent for blob sidecars [ ⚠️ Under Development ].

This registry is designed to **reduce reliance on centralized providers** by creating a **publicly accessible, decentralized list of historical data sources**. It aligns with **EIP-4444** and **Portal Network** efforts to ensure that Ethereum clients can obtain block history **beyond what traditional p2p sync provides**.
Additionally, some providers may distribute historical data through **torrents**, offering alternative sync options.

**Type** indicates whether the endpoint is a **torrent** or **web** endpoint.

# Contributing

If you'd like to add your endpoint to the list please read the [documentation](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Credits

This repository is based on the template from [eth-clients/checkpoint-sync-endpoints](https://github.com/eth-clients/checkpoint-sync-endpoints), adapted to list **Ethereum execution layer historical data providers** instead of Beacon Chain checkpoint sync sources.  

Thanks to the broader **Ethereum community** for supporting decentralized historical data distribution.
